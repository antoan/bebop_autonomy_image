# Memory of the MJPEG Image Bridging Task

This document summarizes the conversation and steps taken to bridge ROS1 images from a Docker container to a ROS2 host.

## 1. The Problem

The user needed to get the camera image feed from a ROS1 Melodic `bebop_autonomy` stack running inside a Docker container to their host machine, which is running Kubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Jazzy. A direct `ros1_bridge` was not a viable option due to system incompatibilities.

## 2. The Proposed Solution

After the user provided context, we decided on the following approach:

*   **Use an MJPEG stream:** This was chosen for its simplicity, reliability, and low overhead compared to alternatives like RTSP.
*   **ROS1 `web_video_server`:** Serve the `/bebop/image_raw` topic from within the ROS1 container as an MJPEG stream over HTTP.
*   **ROS2 Python Node:** Create a Python script on the ROS2 host to consume the MJPEG stream using OpenCV and republish it as a `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` topic.

## 3. Implementation Steps

The task was broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Plan the Solution:** We agreed on the MJPEG approach as the best path forward.
2.  **Modify Dockerfile:** We checked the `Dockerfile.new` and confirmed that `ros-melodic-web-video-server` was already being installed, so no changes were needed.
3.  **Update ROS1 Launch File:** The `bebop_autonomy/bebop_driver/launch/main.launch` file was modified to include a node that starts the `web_video_server` on port `8088`.
4.  **Create ROS2 Bridge Node:** A Python script, `mjpeg_to_ros2_compressed.py`, was created on the host to handle the conversion from the MJPEG stream to a ROS2 topic.
5.  **Provide Instructions:** A detailed `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file was created to guide the user on how to build the Docker image, run the container, and launch the full bridging solution.

## 4. Key Files Created/Modified

*   **Modified:** `bebop_autonomy/bebop_driver/launch/main.launch`
*   **Created:** `mjpeg_to_ros2_compressed.py`
*   **Created:** `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
*   **Created:** `memory.md` (this file)
